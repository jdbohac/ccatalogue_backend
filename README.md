# Calhoun Catalog Frontend repository

This is the front-end for an inventory cataloging app for a small steel-works shop.

The front-end was built on React framework with Material UI for consistent styling.  

The deployed version of this site is [available here](http://calhouncatalog.herokuapp.com/). 

This app was built as my final capstone project during my tenure at General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp.
I learned Ruby on Rails to quickly and easily develop the back-end API.
